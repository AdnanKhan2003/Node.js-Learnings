1. What is Express.js?
- Express.js is a Node.js framework
- A package that adds a bunch of 'utility functions & tools' and a clear set of rules on how the app should be built (middleware)
- It is highly extensible and other packages can be plugged into it (middleware)

2. Middleware, next() and res()
- Express.js relies heavily on middleware functions-
  you can easily add them by calling 'use()'
- Middleware functions handle a request and should call 'next()' to forward that request to the next function in line or send a response

3. Routing
- You can filter requests by path and method
- If you filter by method, paths are matched EXACTLY    ,
otherwise, the FIRST SEGMENT of a URL is matched
- You can use the express.Router to split your routes accross files elegantely

4. Serve files
- You're not limited to serving dummy text as a response
- You can send files to your users using 'sendFile()' and 'path' module. 
  e.g: HTML files
- If a request is directly made for a file (e.g: a '.css' file is requested), you can enable static serving for such files via express.static()
