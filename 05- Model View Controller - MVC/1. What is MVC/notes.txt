What is MVC?
-> Separation of Concerns

Model:
-> Represent your data in your code
-> Work with your data (e.g: fetch, save)

View:
-> What the users sees
-> Decoupled from your application code

Controller:
-> Connecting your Models and your Views
-> Contains the "in-between" logic

Controllers are split across "Middleware Functions"
Controllers -> Routes
