I) SQL vs NoSQL

Goal:
STORE data and make it ACCESSIBLE

Use a Database: Quicker access than with a file
1. SQL Databases eg: MySQL
2. NoSQL Databases eg: MongoDB

What is SQL?
-> Structured Query Language
-> It thinks in tables which has rows and columns
-> It allows you to relate tables

Core SQL Database Characteristics

Data Schema
-> How data should like, which fiels it should contain, which type of data each field STORE
-> Strongly & strictly defined Schema

Data Relations
-> We relate our different tables with basically 3 important kinds of Relations

1. One-to-One
-> Each records fits 1 other record
2. One-to-Many
-> A records fits mutliple other record
3. Many-to-Many
-> Mutliple records fits 1 other mutliple record

SQL Queries
-> Queries are simply commands we use to interact with database
Eg: SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 28
