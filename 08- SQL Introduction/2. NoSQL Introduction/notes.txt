1) NoSQL
-> Instead of having 'schemas' & 'relations' it has other strengths

2) SQL        NoSQL
Tables     Collection
Records    Documents

- NoSQL does NOT have strict schema
You can store multiple documents with different structure in the same collection
- Fast and efficient

3) NoSQL characteristics
1. NO Data schema
-> No structure required

2. NO Data relations
-> No/Few connections
Instead try to copy data and have a collection with documents that work with their own 

NOTE: You can relate documents but you dont' have to
(and you should NOT do it too much or your queries become slow)
