1) Horizontal Vs. Vertical Scaling

Horizontal Scaling
-> Add more servers (and merge Data into one Database)

Vertical Scaling
-> Improve Server Capacity / Hardware (memory or CPU)

2) SQL Vs. NoSQL

SQL
1. Data uses Schemas
2. Relations
3. Data is distributed across multiple tables
4. Horizontal scaling is difficult / impossible; Vertical scaling is possible
5. Limitations for lots of (thousands) read & write queries per second

NoSQL
1. Schema-less
2. No (or very few) Relations
3. Data is typically merged/nested in a few collections
4. Both Horizontal and Vertical scaling is possible
5. Greate performance for mass read & write requests
