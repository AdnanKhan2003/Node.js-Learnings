HOW THE WEB WORKS?
- There's a client & a server
- Whenever we searches for some webpage,
the client reaches out to DNS (Domain Name
Server) to get the real address i.e. IP Address
of that domain name
- Once it's done, client makes a request to the
server with that given IP address
(Node.js is used to run JavaScript outside of
browser which also includes server)
- With server-side code we then handle request
and some response
- This response data can be a HTML page, or some
file, XML Doc, or maybe just JSON data
- Both request and response contains headers 
which is metadata required for communication to
happen between these 2 components
- HTTP/HTTPS protocol is used to make this 
communication possible
- HTTP/HTTPS protocol is just a set of predefined
rules required for 2 devices to communicate
- Before communication a connection between client
and server is built through something called TCP
Transmission Control Protocol
- Once this connection is made, IP Internet Protocol
divides data into small packets, so that it could
travel faster through the routes
- Packets after reaching destination is reassembled
into 1 unit so original data
- We write server-side code to security purpose like
validating user input, connecting to database, etc.
