1. How the Web Works?
-> Client => Request => Server => Response => Client

2. Program Lifecycle & Event Loop
-> Node.js runs non-blocking code
-> Also uses an event-driven code for running your logic
-> A Node program exits as soon as there is no more work to do
-> NOTE: The createServer() event never finishes by default

3. Asynchronous code
-> JS code is non-blocking
-> Use callbacks and events
-> Order changes!

4. Requests & Responses
-> Parse request data into chunks  (Streams & Buffers)
-> Avoid "double responses"

5. Node.js & Core Modules
-> Node.js ships with multiple core modules (http, fs, path, ...)
-> Core modules can be imported into any file to be used there
-> Import via require('module')

6. The Node Module System
-> Import via require ('./path-to-file') for custom files or 
require('module') for core & third-party modules
-> Export via module.exports or just exports (for multiple exports)
