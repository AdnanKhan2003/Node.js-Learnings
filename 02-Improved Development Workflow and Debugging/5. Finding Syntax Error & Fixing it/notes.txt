How Syntax errror can be?
1. Typos
2. Missing Syntax

1. Typos (May occur in reserved keywords)
=> 'const', 'let' may be written wrong like 'cons' or 'les'

2. Missing Syntax
=> Missing 'semicolon' (;) or 'curly braces' ({})

How to Find them?

1. Finding Typos Errors
=> Terminal would show the line at which there may be typo error
=> Have a good look at that line and you may find it

2. Finding Missing Syntax Errors
=> It may be inaccurate, here in this case, it just points to package in which error occurs
=> Have a good look at code and analyse whether there is any missing 'curly-braces' ({}) or  'semicolon' (;)
