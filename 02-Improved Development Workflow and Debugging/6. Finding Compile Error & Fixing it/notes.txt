How we find out this compile time error

Terminal gave us some hint

Hint 1:
You cann't write headers after they're sent to the client
Hint 2: 
Error occured at line 51 where we're resetting headers

Mistake: 
We forgot to return from the function once one of the if case is satisfied

Solution: 
Either add return statement at each if statement
or wrap the bottom most code (which isn't inside if block) inside if statements
