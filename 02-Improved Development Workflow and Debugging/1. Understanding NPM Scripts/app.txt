1. Reserved
-> Ex: 'start'
-> Can run just after prepending npm before reserved script name(npm)

2. Manual
-> Ex: 'anything'
-> Have to prepend 2 words before custom script name(npm run)

NOTE: Must add double inverted comma on 'key', 'value' pairs EXCEPT for arrays, objects, numbers, true, false values
